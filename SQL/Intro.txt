-- MySQL --> DATABASE

Q. What is a Database?
A. It is a collection of data in a format that can be easily accessed.

Q. Why databases?
A. . Can store large data
   . Features like security, scalability etc.
   . Easier to search, insert, update or delete data


SQL DB                           NoSQL DB
- Relational Database            - Non Relational Database
(data stored in Tables)          - (data stored in document/key-vallgraphs etc.)

eg - MySQL, Oracle               eg - MongoDb, Cassandra,
PostgreSQL etc.                  Neo4j etc.

--NoSQL databases can have several advantages over SQL databases, including:
--Flexibility:
-NoSQL databases can store data in a more free-form way, without rigid schemas. 
 This allows developers to focus on creating systems that better serve their customers, 
 without worrying about schemas.

--Scalability:
-NoSQL databases can handle large volumes of data at high speed with a scale-out architecture.

--Performance:
-NoSQL databases can often outperform SQL databases because all the information is contained inside one database. 
 This means that it's faster to perform read or write operations on one data entity compared with SQL databases.

--Cost:
-NoSQL databases often require less hardware and infrastructure than SQL databases, making them cheaper to maintain in the long run. 
 They can also be more efficient in their use of disk space and memory because they don't need to store data in a relational format.



-- SQL: Structured Query Language --
- SQL is a programming language used to interact with relational databases.

-- Schema --
-A database schema is a blueprint that defines the logical structure, organization, and 
 relationships of a relational database.
